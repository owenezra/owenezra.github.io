  <h1>Personalized Tutoring with Owen Onderdonk</h1>
  
  <p>With over 15 years of experience designing and implementing adaptive, personalized learning experiences, I am well-equipped to provide high-quality tutoring tailored to your unique needs and goals. My approach focuses on:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Customized learning plans</strong>: I work closely with each student to understand their strengths, challenges, and objectives. Together, we develop a personalized roadmap to accelerate your learning and achievement.</li>
    <li><strong>Engaging, interactive sessions</strong>: My tutoring incorporates a blend of discussion, problem-solving, and hands-on practice. I utilize virtual collaboration tools, curated online resources, and live 1:1 and small group interactions to keep you actively engaged.</li>
    <li><strong>Expertise in diverse subjects</strong>: I have deep knowledge in mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, and emerging technologies like AI and machine learning. I can guide you in both traditional academic topics and cutting-edge fields.</li>
    <li><strong>Proven results</strong>: As an instructor, I have consistently helped students excel. For example, I increased state math testing scores by 20% and achieved a 96% passing rate by leveraging data analysis and online tools to personalize learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Supportive mentor</strong>: With experience training adult learners and creating psychological safety, I strive to be a supportive mentor who empowers you to tackle challenges with confidence. I actively listen, provide constructive feedback, and adapt my approach to your evolving needs.</li>
  </ul>
